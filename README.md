# DATADRONE: An Asynchronous Web Scraping Framework

## Project Plan

To create a powerful asynchronous web scraping framework using `httpx`, follow the steps below:

1. [ ] **Set Up Project Structure**
    - Organize directories (e.g., `async_scraper/`, `tests/`, `examples/`).
    - Create essential files like `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `LICENSE`.

2. [ ] **Configure Dependency Management**
    - Add dependencies such as `httpx`, `asyncio`, `BeautifulSoup` or `lxml` for parsing.
    - Set up development dependencies like `pytest` for testing and `black` for formatting.

3. [ ] **Implement the Core Request Handler**
    - Utilize `httpx.AsyncClient` for making asynchronous HTTP requests.
    - Handle session management, retries, and error handling.

4. [ ] **Develop the URL Scheduler**
    - Create a scheduler to manage and prioritize URLs to be scraped.
    - Implement features like deduplication and rate limiting.

5. [ ] **Build the Parser Module**
    - Integrate parsing libraries to extract data from HTML/XML.
    - Allow users to define custom parsing rules or selectors.

6. [ ] **Create Middleware Support**
    - Develop a middleware system to allow customization of requests and responses.
    - Enable features like request throttling, proxies, and user-agent rotation.

7. [ ] **Implement Data Pipeline**
    - Design a pipeline to process and store scraped data.
    - Support multiple storage backends (e.g., JSON, CSV, databases).

8. [ ] **Develop Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
    - Create a CLI for users to run scraping tasks.
    - Include options for configuring spiders, output formats, and settings.

9. [ ] **Write Comprehensive Documentation and Tests**
    - Document all modules, classes, and functions with usage examples.
    - Write unit and integration tests to ensure framework reliability.
    - Set up Continuous Integration (CI) for automated testing.

## Getting Started

Follow the checklist above to build the AsyncScraper framework step by step. Each task will help you develop a robust and flexible web scraping tool leveraging the power of asynchronous programming with `httpx`.
