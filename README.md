# DATAdRONE: An Asynchronous Web Scraping Framework

To create a powerful asynchronous web scraping framework using `httpx`, follow the steps below:

> **High-performance asynchronous scraping framework powered by [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org/).**

## Project Plan

1. [x] **Set Up Project Structure**  
   *Basic scaffolding and initial code setup.*

2. [x] **Implement HTTPX Async Client**  
   *Core client with retries, statistics, and logging.*

3. [ ] **Handle Browser Interactions**  
   *Planned: Integrate headless browser automation (e.g., Playwright).*

4. [ ] **Implement Parser with XPATH**  
   *Planned: Add advanced parsing features for complex DOM structures.*

5. [ ] **Create Middleware Support**  
   *Planned: Add middlewares for request/response transformations.*

6. [ ] **Develop Command-Line Interface (CLI)**  
   *Planned: Provide a user-friendly way to run scrapers and manage tasks.*

7. [ ] **Write Comprehensive Documentation and Tests**  
   *Planned: Improve docs, examples, and test coverage.*

## Possible Future Features

- **Distributed Task Scheduling**: Integrate task queues (e.g., Celery or RQ) for large-scale scraping.
- **Session Management**: Automatic session pooling, caching, and cookie handling.
- **Pluggable Storage**: Flexible storage backends for scraped data.
- **Dynamic Proxy Support**: Auto-rotation of proxies to avoid IP bans.
- **Hook System**: Register pre- and post-request hooks for customizing requests on-the-fly.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Enable third-party extensions and specialized scraping components.
